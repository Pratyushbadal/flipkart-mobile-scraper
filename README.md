# Scrapping Flipkart Products

**Important Note:**

> Flipkart now uses JavaScript to render most product data on their website. This means that traditional scraping methods (like requests + BeautifulSoup) used in this project will no longer work for live product data, as the required information is not present in the initial HTML response. As a result, this project does not work anymore for scraping live Flipkart product listings.

This repository contains a Python script for scraping product details from Flipkart
